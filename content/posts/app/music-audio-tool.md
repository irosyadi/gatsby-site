## Audio Tools

## Virtual Audio Case
### Audio Recording - Transcription

Benefits/drawbacks:

- We cannot listen the audio output from playback apps

![VAC Audio Recording](_v_images/20211023055131420_4883.png)

Use cases:

- Record Zoom Webinar to Audacity
- Transcribe Zoom Webinar to Speechtexter, Google Docs etc.

### Audio Input Mixing

![Audio Input Mixing](_v_images/20211023055947660_4903.png)

Use cases:

- Record with multiple input (our voice + music from AIMP) to Audacity
- Broadcast with multiple input (our voice + music from AIMP) to Zoom, Youtube etc.

### Audio Output Mixing

![Audio Output Mixing](_v_images/20211023060503358_26770.png)

Use cases:

- Transcribe (and listen) Zoom Seminar to Speaker and Speechtexter, Google Docs

### Zoom Audio Recording/Transcription

### Google Meet Audio Transcription

- Open Google Meet, using default Mic
- Open Speechtexter, using default Mic

But we cannot do both Speechtexter and Google Docs
We cannot do both Speechtexter and Voice Note
We can do both Google Meet and Speechtexter/VoiceNote/Dictanote
We can do both Zoom and Speechtexter/VoiceNote/Dictanote
