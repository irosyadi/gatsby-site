### Linear Regression with One Variable :

1. Consider the problem of predicting how well a student does in her second year of college/university, given how well she did in her first year. Specifically, let x be equal to the number of “A” grades (including A-. A and A+ grades) that a student receives in their first year of college (freshmen year). We would like to predict the value of y, which we define as the number of “A” grades they get in their second year (sophomore year).  
    Here each row is one training example. Recall that in linear regression, our hypothesis is $h_\theta(x)=\theta_0+\theta_1x$ to denote the number of training examples.  
    ![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irosyadi/vnote.image/master/1610253270_20210106042809097_6366.png)  
    For the training set given above (note that this training set may also be referenced in other questions in this $m$)? In the box below, please enter your answer (which should be a number between 0 and 10).  
    
    ```
    4 
    ```
2. Many substances that can burn (such as gasoline and alcohol) have a chemical structure based on carbon atoms; for this reason they are called hydrocarbons. A chemist wants to understand how the number of carbon atoms in a molecule affects how much energy is released when that molecule combusts (meaning that it is burned). The chemist obtains the dataset below. In the column on the right, “kJ/mol” is the unit measuring the amount of energy released.  
      
    ![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irosyadi/vnote.image/master/1610253268_20210106042807663_5970.png)  
      
     You would like to use linear regression $h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1x$ to estimate the amount of energy released (y) as a function of the number of carbon atoms (x). Which of the following do you think will be the values you obtain for $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ ? You should be able to select the right answer without actually implementing linear regression.  

    - ☐ $\theta_0$ = −569.6, $\theta_1$ = 530.9
    - ☐ $\theta_0$ = −1780.0, $\theta_1$ = −530.9
    - 🗹 $\theta_0$ = −569.6, $\theta_1$ = −530.9
    - ☐ $\theta_0$ = −1780.0, $\theta_1$ = 530.9

2. For this question, assume that we are using the training set from Q1.  
    Recall our definition of the cost function was $J(\theta_0, \theta_1 ) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h (x^{(i)} ) - y^{(i)})^2$  
    What is $J(0,1)$? In the box below,  
    please enter your answer (Simplify fractions to decimals when entering answer, and ‘.’ as the decimal delimiter e.g., 1.5).  
    ```
    0.5
    ```
3. Suppose we set $\theta_0 = 0, \theta_1 = 1.5$ in the linear regression hypothesis from Q1. What is $h_\theta(2)$ ?  
    ```
    3
    ```
3. Suppose we set $\theta_0 = -2, \theta_1 = 0.5$ in the linear regression hypothesis from Q1. What is $h_\theta(6)$?  
    ```
    1
    ```
5. Let $f$ be some function so that $f(\theta_0 , \theta_1 )$ outputs a number. For this problem, f is some arbitrary/unknown smooth function (not necessarily the cost function of linear regression, so f may have local optima).
Suppose we use gradient descent to try to minimize $f(\theta_0 , \theta_1 )$ as a function of $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$.
Which of the following statements are true? (Check all that apply.)
    - 🗹 If $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ are initialized at the global minimum, then one iteration will not change their values.
    - ☐ Setting the learning rate $\alpha$ to be very small is not harmful, and can only speed up the convergence of gradient descent.
    - ☐ No matter how $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ are initialized, so long as $\alpha$ is sufficiently small, we can safely expect gradient descent to converge to the same solution.
    - 🗹  If the first few iterations of gradient descent cause $f(\theta_0 , \theta_1)$ to increase rather than decrease, then the most likely cause is that we have set the learning rate $\alpha$ to too large a value.
5. In the given figure, the cost function $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ has been plotted against $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$, as shown in ‘Plot 2’. The contour plot for the same cost function is given in ‘Plot 1’. Based on the figure, choose the correct options (check all that apply).
![Plots for Cost Function](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irosyadi/vnote.image/master/1610253271_20210106045949479_13558.png)
    - ☐ If we start from point B, gradient descent with a well-chosen learning rate will eventually help us reach at or near point A, as the value of cost function $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ is maximum at point A.
    - ☐ If we start from point B, gradient descent with a well-chosen learning rate will eventually help us reach at or near point C, as the value of cost function $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ is minimum at point C.
    - 🗹 Point P (the global minimum of plot 2) corresponds to point A of Plot 1.
    - 🗹 If we start from point B, gradient descent with a well-chosen learning rate will eventually help us reach at or near point A, as the value of cost function $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$ is minimum at A.
    - ☐ Point P (The global minimum of plot 2) corresponds to point C of Plot 1.
6. Suppose that for some linear regression problem (say, predicting housing prices as in the lecture), we have some training set, and for our training set we managed to find some $\theta_0, \theta_1$, such that $J(\theta_0 , \theta_1) = 0$.
Which of the statements below must then be true? (Check all that apply.)
    - ☐ Gradient descent is likely to get stuck at a local minimum and fail to find the global minimum.
    - ☐ For this to be true, we must have $\theta_0 = 0$ and $\theta_1 = 0$
so that $h_{\theta}(x) = 0$
    - ☐ For this to be true, we must have $y^{(i)} = 0$ for every value of $i = 1, 2,…,m$.
    - 🗹 Our training set can be fit perfectly by a straight line, i.e., all of our training examples lie perfectly on some straight line.

## Week 4
### Logistic Regression :
1. Suppose that you have trained a logistic regression classifier, and it outputs on a new example a prediction $h_\theta(x) = 0.2$. This means (check all that apply):

    - 🗹 Our estimate for P(y = 0|x; θ) is 0.8.
    - 🗹 Our estimate for P(y = 1|x; θ) is 0.2.
    - ☐ Our estimate for P(y = 0|x; θ) is 0.2.
2. Suppose you have the following training set, and fit a logistic regression classifier $h_\theta(x) = g(\theta_0 + \theta_1x_1 + \theta_2x_2)$.
Which of the following are true? Check all that apply.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irosyadi/vnote.image/master/1610253274_20210106083228677_5192.png)
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irosyadi/vnote.image/master/1610253275_20210106083244202_2232.png)
    - 🗹 Adding polynomial features (e.g., instead using $h_\theta(x) = g(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \theta_3 x_1^2 + \theta_4 x_1 x_2 + \theta_5 x_2^2 ))$ could increase how well we can fit the training data.
    - 🗹 At the optimal value of θ (e.g., found by fminunc), we will have $J(θ) ≥ 0$.
    - ☐ Adding polynomial features (e.g., instead using $h_\theta(x) = g(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \theta_3 x_1^2 + \theta_4 x_1 x_2 + \theta_5 x_2^2 ))$ would increase $J(θ)$ because we are now summing over more terms.
    - ☐ If we train gradient descent for enough iterations, for some examples $x^{(i)}$ in the training set it is possible to obtain $h_\theta(x^{(i)} ) > 1$.
3. For logistic regression, the gradient is given by $\frac{\partial }{\partial \theta_j } J(\theta) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{i})x^{(i)}_j$. Which of these is a correct gradient descent update for logistic regression with a learning rate of $\alpha$ ? Check all that apply.
    - 🗹 $\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)-y^i}) x^{(i)}_j$ (simultaneously update for all j).
    - ☐ $\theta := \theta - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (\theta^Tx-y^{(i)}) x^{(i)}$.
    - 🗹 $\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left(\frac{1}{1+e^{-\theta^Tx^{(i)}}}-y^{(i)}\right) x^{(i)}_j$ (simultaneously update for all j).
    - ☐ $\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)-y^i}) x^{(i)}$ (simultaneously update for all j).
4. Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.
    - 🗹 The one-vs-all technique allows you to use logistic regression for problems in which each $y^{(i)}$ comes from a fixed, discrete set of values.
    - ☐ For logistic regression, sometimes gradient descent will converge to a local minimum (and fail to find the global minimum). This is the reason we prefer more advanced optimization algorithms such as fminunc (conjugate gradient/BFGS/L-BFGS/etc).
    - 🗹 The cost function $J(\theta)$ for logistic regression trained with $m \geq 1$ examples is always greater than or equal to zero.
    - ☐ Since we train one classifier when there are two classes, we train two classifiers when there are three classes (and we do one-vs-all classification).
5. Suppose you train a logistic classifier $h_\theta(x) = g(\theta_0 + \theta_1x_1 + \theta_2x_2)$. Suppose $\theta_0 = 6$, $\theta_1 = -1$, $\theta_2 = 0$. Which of the following figures represents the decision boundary found by your classifier?

### Regularization
1. You are training a classification model with logistic regression. Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.
    - ☐ Introducing regularization to the model always results in equal or better performance on the training set.
    - ☐ Introducing regularization to the model always results in equal or better performance on examples not in the training set.
    - 🗹 Adding a new feature to the model always results in equal or better performance on the training set.
    - ☐ Adding many new features to the model helps prevent overfitting on the training set.
2. Suppose you ran logistic regression twice, once with $\lambda = 0$, and once with $\lambda = 1$. One of the times, you got parameters $\theta = \begin{bmatrix} 74.81\\ 45.05 \end{bmatrix}$, and the other time you got $\theta = \begin{bmatrix} 1.37\\ 0.51 \end{bmatrix}$. However, you forgot which value of $\lambda$ corresponds to which value of $\theta$. Which one do you think corresponds to $\lambda = 1$?
    - 🗹 $\theta = \begin{bmatrix} 1.37\\ 0.51 \end{bmatrix}$
    - ☐ $\theta = \begin{bmatrix} 74.81\\ 45.05 \end{bmatrix}$
3. Which of the following statements about regularization are true? Check all that apply.
    - ☐ Using a very large value of $\lambda$ hurt the performance of your hypothesis; the only reason we do not set $\lambda$ to be too large is to avoid numerical problems.
    - ☐ Because logistic regression outputs values $0 \leq h_\theta(x) \leq 1$, its range of output values can only be “shrunk” slightly by regularization anyway, so regularization is generally not helpful for it.
    - 🗹 Consider a classification problem. Adding regularization may cause your classifier to incorrectly classify some training examples (which it had correctly classified when not using regularization, i.e. when $\lambda = 0$).
    - ☐ Using too large a value of $\lambda$ can cause your hypothesis to overfit the data; this can be avoided by reducing $\lambda$.
4. Which of the following statements about regularization are true? Check all that apply.
    - ☐ Using a very large value of $\lambda$ hurt the performance of your hypothesis; the only reason we do not set $\lambda$ to be too large is to avoid numerical problems.
    - ☐ Because logistic regression outputs values $0 \leq h_\theta(x) \leq 1$, its range of output values can only be “shrunk” slightly by regularization anyway, so regularization is generally not helpful for it.
    - ☐ Because regularization causes $J(\theta)$ to no longer be convex, gradient descent may not always converge to the global minimum (when $\lambda > 0$, and when using an appropriate learning rate $\alpha$).
    - 🗹 Using too large a value of $\lambda$ can cause your hypothesis to underfit the data; this can be avoided by reducing $\lambda$.

3. Let $J(\theta) = 2\theta^3 + 2$. Let $\theta = 1$, and $\epsilon = 0.01$. Use the formula $\frac{J{(\theta + \epsilon)}-J{(\theta - \epsilon)}}{2\epsilon}$ to numerically compute an approximation to the derivative at $\theta = 1$. What value do you get? (When $\theta = 1$, the true/exact derivative is $\frac{\mathrm{d} J(\theta)}{\mathrm{d} \theta} = 6$.)
    - ☐ 8
    - 🗹 6.0002
    - ☐ 6
    - ☐ 5.9998
4. Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.
    - 🗹 For computational efficiency, after we have performed gradient checking to verify that our backpropagation code is correct, we usually disable gradient checking before using backpropagation to train the network.
    - ☐ Computing the gradient of the cost function in a neural network has the same efficiency when we use backpropagation or when we numerically compute it using the method of gradient checking.
    - 🗹 Using gradient checking can help verify if one’s implementation of backpropagation is bug-free.
    - ☐ Gradient checking is useful if we are using one of the advanced optimization methods (such as in fminunc) as our optimization algorithm. However, it serves little purpose if we are using gradient descent.
5. Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.
    - 🗹 If we are training a neural network using gradient descent, one reasonable “debugging” step to make sure it is working is to plot $J(\theta)$ as a function of the number of iterations, and make sure it is decreasing (or at least non-increasing) after each iteration.
    - ☐ Suppose you have a three layer network with parameters $\theta^{(1)}$ (controlling the function mapping from the inputs to the hidden units) and $\theta^{(2)}$ (controlling the mapping from the hidden units to the outputs). If we set all the elements of $\theta^{(1)}$ to be 0, and all the elements of $\theta^{(2)}$ to be 1, then this suffices for symmetry breaking, since the neurons are no longer all computing the same function of the input.
    - 🗹 Suppose you are training a neural network using gradient descent. Depending on your random initialization, your algorithm may converge to different local optima (i.e., if you run the algorithm twice with different random initializations, gradient descent may converge to two different solutions).
    - ☐ If we initialize all the parameters of a neural network to ones instead of zeros, this will suffice for the purpose of “symmetry breaking” because the parameters are no longer symmetrically equal to zero.

3. Suppose you have implemented regularized logistic regression to classify what object is in an image (i.e., to do object recognition). However, when you test your hypothesis on a new set of images, you find that it makes unacceptably large errors with its predictions on the new images. However, your hypothesis performs well (has low error) on the training set. Which of the following are promising steps to take? Check all that apply.
NOTE: Since the hypothesis performs well (has low error) on the training set, it is suffering from high variance (overfitting)
    - ☐ Try adding polynomial features.
    - ☐ Use fewer training examples.
    - 🗹  Try using a smaller set of features.
    - 🗹 Get more training examples.
    - ☐ Try evaluating the hypothesis on a cross validation set rather than the test set.
    - ☐ Try decreasing the regularization parameter λ.
    - 🗹 Try increasing the regularization parameter λ.

    - 🗹 A typical split of a dataset into training, validation and test sets might be 60% training set, 20% validation set, and 20% test set.
    - ☐ Suppose you are training a logistic regression classifier using polynomial features and want to select what degree polynomial (denoted in the lecture videos) to use. After training the classifier on the entire training set, you decide to use a subset of the training examples as a validation set. This will work just as well as having a validation set that is separate (disjoint) from the training set.
    - ☐ It is okay to use data from the test set to choose the regularization parameter λ, but not the model parameters (θ).
    - 🗹 Suppose you are using linear regression to predict housing prices, and your dataset comes sorted in order of increasing sizes of houses.

6. Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.
    - 🗹 A model with more parameters is more prone to overfitting and typically has higher variance.
    - ☐ If the training and test errors are about the same, adding more features will not help improve the results.
    - 🗹 If a learning algorithm is suffering from high bias, only adding more training examples may not improve the test error significantly.
    - 🗹 If a learning algorithm is suffering from high variance, adding more training examples is likely to improve the test error.
    - 🗹 When debugging learning algorithms, it is useful to plot a learning curve to understand if there is a high bias or high variance problem.
    - ☐ If a neural network has much lower training error than test error, then adding more layers will help bring the test error down because we can fit the test set better.
