### Speech to Text

- [DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) : simpler although inferior
- [Kaldi](https://kaldi-asr.org/) : STT supports hybrid NN-HMM and lattice-free MMI models. Kaldi is used by many people both in research and in production.
- [Lingvo](https://github.com/tensorflow/lingvo) is the open source version of Google speech recognition toolkit, with support mostly for end-to-end models.
- [ESPNet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) is good and well known for end-to-end models as well.
- [RASR](https://github.com/rwth-i6/rasr) + [RETURNN](https://github.com/rwth-i6/returnn) are very good as well, both for end-to-end models and hybrid NN-HMM, but they are for non-commercial applications only (or you need a commercial licence) (disclaimer: I work at the university chair which develops these frameworks).
