- [Facial-Emotion-Detection](https://github.com/PrudhviRaj12/Facial-Emotion-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-and-Representational-Autoencoder-Units) This work showcases two independent methods for recognizing emotions from faces. The first method using representational autoencoder units, a fairly original idea, to classify an image among one of the seven different emotions. The second method uses a 8-layer convolutional neural network which has an original and unique design, and was developed from scratch.

## Ideas
- Real Time Facial Feature Extraction : Emotional + others, video based, handheld based.
- upgrade [juan-csv/Face_info](https://github.com/juan-csv/Face_info) approach
- upgrade [weblineindia/AIML-Human-Attributes-Detection-with-Facial-Feature-Extraction](https://github.com/weblineindia/AIML-Human-Attributes-Detection-with-Facial-Feature-Extraction) approach
- upgrade [m-elkhou/Facial_Expression_Detection](https://github.com/m-elkhou/Facial_Expression_Detection)
