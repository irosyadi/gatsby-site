## Anti-cheating Strategy
- make questions brutal and unique (compared to previous year or current groups) if possible
- mixing (randomizing) the order of questions, 
- not giving question titles, 
- having a pool of subtly different questions (a negation or a different constant slipped in)
- make everything open-book, make the questions things that test understanding instead of just recall or design questions that require critical thinking, and allow everyone to use their computers/books/notes/whatever
- A (simple) /B (reasoning and analysis) /C (problem with deeper understanding): with different weight for example 50/30/20.
- project work
- put a lot of emphasis on group work & home work
- writing essays
- set a tough time limit
- curve the results to a desired grade distribution (that is often imposed from above anyway)
- use software that can the catch most obvious frauds (i.e. 360 degree room scanning, ban use of phones/second computers etc.)
- if the exam requires algorithms, use software analyzing AST of the code produced to catch possible "cooperation", then decide on those cases individually (i.e. if an algorithm is common, then there is a high chance of very similar AST for non-cooperating people, but if it's unique, the chance is low)
