# Machine Learning for Earth Science

## AI for Earth Science
- [Dymaxionlabs](https://dymaxionlabs.com/platform/)
- [School Mapping Github by DymaxionLabs](https://github.com/dymaxionlabs/school-mapping)

## Climate
- [Climate indices](https://github.com/monocongo/climate_indices) (BSD-3-Clause) : Python implementations of various climate index algorithms which provide a geographical and temporal picture of the severity of precipitation and temperature anomalies useful for climate monitoring and research.
- [MIT Climate CoLab](https://www.climatecolab.org/) : A collaborative online community centered around a series of annual contests that seek out promising ideas for fighting climate change.
- [Climate Action Challenge](https://challenge.whatdesigncando.com) : global design competition calling on the creative community to submit bold, innovative solutions to combat the impacts of climate change.
