## Learning
### Case-based Learning
- With case-based teaching, students develop skills in analytical thinking and reflective judgment by reading and discussing complex, real-life scenarios. 
- Case studies are stories that are used as a teaching tool to show the application of a theory or concept to real situations. Dependent on the goal they are meant to fulfill, cases can be fact-driven and deductive where there is a correct answer, or they can be context driven where multiple solutions are possible. 
- Case-based learning (CBL) is an established approach used across disciplines where students apply their knowledge to real-world scenarios, promoting higher levels of cognition. In CBL classrooms, students typically work in groups on case studies, stories involving one or more characters and/or scenarios.  The cases present a disciplinary problem or problems for which students devise solutions under the guidance of the instructor. 
- CBL:
    - Cases
    - Questions:
        - Assessment
        - Diagnosis
        - Recommendation/Action
    - Team-discussions:
        - Elaboration
        - Emphasis

[Case-Based Teaching | MGH Institute of Health Professions](https://www.mghihp.edu/faculty-staff-faculty-compass-teaching/case-based-teaching)


### Problem-based Learning
- PBL consists of carefully designed problems that challenge students to use problem solving techniques, self-directed learning strategies, team participation skills, and disciplinary knowledge.

### CBL vs PBL
- PBL involves open rather than guided inquiry, is less structured, and the instructor plays a more passive role. In PBL multiple solutions to the problem may exit, but the problem is often initially not well-defined. PBL also has a stronger emphasis on developing self-directed learning.
