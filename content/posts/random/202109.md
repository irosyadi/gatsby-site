So little of success in ML comes from the sexy algorithms and so much just comes from ensuring a bunch of boring details get properly saved in the right place.
After months learning about machine learning for time series forecasting, several chapters in a book on deep learning techniques for time series analysis and forecasting, the author kindly pointed out that there are no papers published up to that point that prove deep learning (neural networks) can perform better than classical statistics.
Career lesson: Ask a lot of questions early in a project's life. If you're working on something that uses machine learning, ask what system it's replacing, and make sure that someone (or you) runs it manually before spending the time to automate.

## Basic Linux
Note that these suggestions are *off the top of my head* and surely biased by my own needs.

1. `bash` shell basics  
    1. Navigating the shell.
    2. Using one of the common editors, such as `vim`, `emacs`, or `nano`. My personal favorite is `vim`, but that's probably because I've been using it (or its predecessor, `vi`) longer than most redditors have been alive.
    3. Listing (`ls`) and deleting (`rm`) files.
    4. Changing file permissions (`chmod`).
2. Using the `find` command.
3. Using basic Linux tools in pipelines, such as `tr`, `wc`, `basename`, `dirname`, etc.
4. Using `awk`/`gawk`. This tool is so incredibly powerful. I use it almost daily.
5. Using `apt`. Note that `apt-get` is the older package manager, and although it's largely compatible with `apt`, there are some differences.
6. Programming  
    1. Learn the basics of `bash` shell programming, including conditional statements, looping structures, variables, etc.
    2. Definitely learn `python`, with a focus on `python3`.
    3. php: see Web Dev below.
    4. Learning C and/or C++ are desirable too, but you don't need this skill immediately. However, knowing these languages will give you better knowledge for compiling packages and eventually writing your own.
7. Web servers  
    1. You won't go wrong with `apache2`, but these days, I'm using `nginx` more often.
    2. Installing SSL/TLS certs.
8. Networking  
    1. Using `iptables` to configure firewall rules.
    2. Using `ip route` to configure routes.
