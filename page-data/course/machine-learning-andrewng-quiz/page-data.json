The recommended way to choose what value of regularization parameter to use is to choose the value of which gives the lowest cross validation error.</li>\n<li>🗹 A typical split of a dataset into training, validation and test sets might be 60% training set, 20% validation set, and 20% test set.</li>\n<li>☐ Suppose you are training a logistic regression classifier using polynomial features and want to select what degree polynomial (denoted in the lecture videos) to use. After training the classifier on the entire training set, you decide to use a subset of the training examples as a validation set. This will work just as well as having a validation set that is separate (disjoint) from the training set.</li>\n<li>☐ It is okay to use data from the test set to choose the regularization parameter λ, but not the model parameters (θ).</li>\n<li>🗹 Suppose you are using linear regression to predict housing prices, and your dataset comes sorted in order of increasing sizes of houses. It is then important to randomly shuffle the dataset before splitting it into training, validation and test sets, so that we don’t have all the smallest houses going into the training set, and all the largest houses going into the test set.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Which of the following statements are true?
