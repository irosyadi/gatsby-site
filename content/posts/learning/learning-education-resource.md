### E-learning Gamification

1. **Challenges**  
These map to the learning objectives or learning goals.
2. **Levels**  
These map to the learning journey and as the learner goes through each level, it signifies a step up in proficiency for them.
3. **Instant feedback**  
This helps learners know how they are faring against their learning goals and based on this, they can adopt the necessary measures to step up their performance.
4. **Scores**  
They are indicators of their performance and are closely aligned to offering gratification as well as a sense of accomplishment.
5. **Badges**  
As the learners go through the learning path and clear certain levels, they are given badges. These reflect affirmations for their significant achievements.
6. **Leaderboards**  
They are dashboards that are used to provide a pictorial view of the overall progress‚Äîincluding against others. The analytics keeps learners connected to the learning journey and aligned to meeting their terminal objectives.
7. **Competition**  
This can be leveraged effectively as it helps learners assess where they stand against other peers or competing teams.
8. **Collaboration**  
This feature not only facilitates team-building but also enables learners to leverage the support of peers or guidance from experts to meet their goals.
9. **Points and currency**  
Points are a variation on badges, and can also be used as currency within a program. For instance, you can offer learners a point for every comment the leave in the discussion forum, and then let them redeem a certain number of points for rewards and discounts.
10. **Progress bars and level up**  
Progress bars can help by visualizing their advancements. You can even add a bit of interest by creating ‚Äúlevel ups‚Äù that unlock new course features.

### Anti-cheating Strategy in Testing

- make questions brutal and unique (compared to previous year or current groups) if possible
- mixing (randomizing) the order of questions,
- not giving question titles,
- having a pool of subtly different questions (a negation or a different constant slipped in)
- make everything open-book, make the questions things that test understanding instead of just recall or design questions that require critical thinking, and allow everyone to use their computers/books/notes/whatever
- A (simple) /B (reasoning and analysis) /C (problem with deeper understanding): with different weight for example 50/30/20.
- project work
- put a lot of emphasis on group work & home work
- writing essays
- set a tough time limit
- curve the results to a desired grade distribution (that is often imposed from above anyway)
- use software that can the catch most obvious frauds (i.e. 360 degree room scanning, ban use of phones/second computers etc.)
- if the exam requires algorithms, use software analyzing AST of the code produced to catch possible "cooperation", then decide on those cases individually (i.e. if an algorithm is common, then there is a high chance of very similar AST for non-cooperating people, but if it's unique, the chance is low)
