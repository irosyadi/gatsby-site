## Slide and Presentation
- Slides that are text only distract the audience. They read the text.
- Slides that are non-self-explanatory images, _require_ the audience to listen to the speaker. Try it. Put two circles on the screen and see what people do. They look at you for explanation.
- TedX has a pretty good style-guide about [slides](https://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_speaker_guide.pdf):
- What goes in my slides?
    - Images and photos: To help the audience remember a person, place or thing you mention, you might use images or photos. People will understand that the images represent what you’re saying, so there is no need to verbally describe the images onscreen.
    - Graphs and infographics. Keep graphs visually clear, even if the content is complex. Each graph should make only one point.
    - No slide should support more than one point.
- What should the slides look like?
    - Use as little text as possible -- if your audience is reading, they are not listening.
    - Avoid using bullet points. Consider putting different points on different slides.
- But, slides with images and no text are a nightmare for non visual person.
- So good slides are: important graphs with little text
- See [Patrick Wilson's "How To Speak"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY)
    - How to Start
        - Do not start a talk with a joke. Audience are not ready yet.
        - Promise - Tell them what they gonna learn at the end of your talk.
    - Samples
        - Cycle – make your idea repeated many times in order to be completely clear for everyone.
        - Make a “Fence” around your idea so that it can be distinguished from someone elses idea.
        - Verbal punctuation – sum up information within your talk some times to make listeners get back on.
        -  Ask a question - intriguing one
    - Place and Time
        - Best time for having a lecture is 11 am (not too early and not after lunch)
        - The place should be well lit.
        - The place should be seen and checked before the lecture.
        - The place should not be full less than a half, it must be chosen according to the amount of listeners.
    - Board and Props
        - Board – it’s got graphics, speed, target. Watch your hands! Don't hold them behind your back, it's better to keep them straight and use for pointing at the board.
        - Props – use them in order to make your ideas visual. Visual perception is the most effective way to interact with listeners.
    - Projections
        - Don't put too many words on a slide. Slides should just reflect what you're saying, not the other way around. Pictures attracts attention and people start to wait for your explanation – use that tip.
        - Make slide as easy as you can – no title, no distracting pictures, frames, points and so on.
        - Do not use laser pointer – due to that you lose eye contact with the audience. Instead you can make the arrows just upon a slide. 
    - Case: Informing (e.g. teaching)
        - Promise: a promise what we'will go through
        - Inspiration: they were inspired when someone exhibited passion about what they were doing
        - How to Think:  Education is continuity of storytelling. So, provide audience with the stories they need to know, the questions they need to ask about those stories, mechanisms for analyzing those stories, ways of putting stories together, ways of evaluating how reliable a story is.
    - Case: Persuading (e.g. oral exam, job talk, getting famous)
    - Oral Exam
        - the most usual reason for people failing an oral exam is failure to situate and a failure to practice. By situate, it's important to talk about our research in context (problem, solution, impact).
    - Job talk
        - Show to your listeners that your stuff is cool and interesting and you're not a rookie
        - You have to be able to: (1) show your vision of that problem, (2) show that you've done particular things (by steps), (3) conclude
        - Vision of a problem that somebody cares about and something new in your approach.
        - How do you express the notion that you've done something? By listing the steps that need to be taken in order to achieve the solution to that problem.
        - And then you conclude by you conclude by enumerating your contributions.
        - All of that should be done real quick in no more than 5 min.
    - Getting Famous: about how you're going to be recognized for what you do.  Your ideas are
like your children, so what you want to do is to be sure that you have techniques, mechanisms, thoughts about how to present ideas that you have so that they're recognized for the value that is in them.
    - If you want to your ideas be remembered you've got to have "5 S":
        - Symbols associate with your ideas (visual perception is the best way to attract attention)
        - Slogan (describing your idea)
        - Surprise (common fallacy that is no longer true, for instance, just after you've told about it)
        - Salient Idea (an idea which not necessarily important but the one that sticks out)
        - Story (how you did it, how it works…)
    - How to Stop Pursuading Presentations
        - Don't put the end with:
            - put collaborators at the end (do that at the beginning).
            - 'questions?'
            - 'link: https://bla.bla'
            - 'the end'
            - 'conclusions' (it will better ended with 'contributions').
            - 'Thank you (for listening)' (except, after applause).
        - Put the end with:
            - contribution
            - jokes, since people then will leave the event feeling fun and thus keep a good memory of your talk.
            - a salute to people (how much you valued the time being here, the people over here..., “I'd like to get back, it was fun!"). With this you won't have to worry about how to end!

## Colorization
- Pix2pix vs CycleGAN
    - Cycle-GAN can work in an 'unpaired' manner and various architectural differences. Unpaired image translation is much harder, as you demand the model to learn objects of different shapes, size, angle, texture, location in different scenes and settings on top of the actual task (coloring in this case). Requires more data and you don't have fine control on the learning. Formulating the coloring problem as a paired task makes more sense as you simply decrease the complexity of the problem without increasing data collection/annotation work.
    - The whole point about using CycleGAN is that it can learn in unpaired situations. And it works well in the context of style transfer tasks where the changes are really bold and less nuanced. But, in the context of image colorization, the changes are really subtle and also there are way more options to choose colors than changing a horse to zebra. The other thing is that learning to change a colored image to black and white is much easier for the model than learning to colorize it which can lead to a bad learning procedure.
    - The most prominent differences is that CycleGAN helps when you have unpaired images and you want to go from one class to the other (Horse to Zebra for example) but in the Pix2Pix paper, the images that you get after the inference, are the input images but with some new features (black&white to colorized or day time to night time of a scene). In pix2pix, a conditional GAN (one generator and one discriminator) is used with some supervision from L1 loss. In CycleGAN, you need two generators and two discriminators to do the task: one pair for going from class A to B and one pair for going from class B to A. Also you need Cycle Consistency Loss to make sure that the models learn to undo the changes they make.

## License: Fair use
- 17 U.S. Code § 107 - Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107
> the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright
- [Overview Sections Archive - Stanford Copyright and Fair Use Center](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/)
- [Summaries of Fair Use Cases - Copyright Overview by Rich Stim - Stanford Copyright and Fair Use Center](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/cases/)
- Fair uses:
    - a fair use is any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and “transformative” purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. 
    - Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner. 
    - Fair use is a defense against a claim of copyright infringement.
- Main categories:
    - Commentary and Criticism : criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research
    - Parody
- Four factors:
    - The Transformative Factor: The Purpose and Character of Your Use
        - Whether the material has been used to help create something new or merely copied verbatim into another work. 
        - So check: [1] Has the material you have taken from the original work been transformed by adding new expression or meaning? [2] Was value added to the original by creating new information, new aesthetics, new insights, and understandings?
        - Example of transformative uses: parody, scholarship, research, or education
    - The Nature of the Copyrighted Work
        - Dissemination of facts or information benefits the public. Fair use copy from factual works  (biographies, facts) is better than you do from fictional (plays or novels).
        - Fair use copy the material from a published work is better than from an unpublished work
    - The Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Taken
        - The less you take, the more likely that your copying will be excused as a fair use, but you are more likely to run into problems if you take the most memorable aspect of a work
    - The Effect of the Use Upon the Potential Market
        - Is whether your use deprives the copyright owner of income or undermines a new or potential market for the copyrighted work.
- Common mistakes:
    - Acknowledgment of the source material (such as citing the photographer) may be a consideration in a fair use determination, but it will not protect against a claim of infringement. So check four factors above.
    - Disclaimers such as  "No Copyright Intended" or fair use claims, don't mean that the work qualifies as a fair use. If the fair use factors weigh against you, the disclaimer wont make any difference. So check four factors above.
- To limit damages:
    - Stating something to the effect of: "No copyright is claimed in [content copied] and to the extent that material may appear to be infringed, I assert that such alleged infringement is permissible under fair use principles in U.S. copyright laws. If you believe material has been used in an unauthorized manner, please contact the poster."
    - Stating disclaimers. "This book is not associated with or endorsed by the xxx Company."

## Gig Economy
- Workers or self-employed?
- The court made very specific arguments:
1. Uber set the fare which meant that they dictated how much drivers could earn 
2. Uber set the contract terms and drivers had no say in them '
3. Request for rides is constrained by Uber who can penalise drivers if they reject too many rides 
4. Uber monitors a driver's service through the star rating and has the capacity to terminate the relationship if after repeated warnings this does not improve
- The main difference I see is the imbalance of power. A self-employed can decide who to work with and negotiate almost everything with them. He have my business, the company have theirs, and they discuss to try to reach agreements or not. Uber drivers are not in this position. Uber can dictate everything they want, drivers can only decide to stay or leave.
- The issue here is that Uber pretends the driver is contracted by the passenger. In which case the driver should be free to negotiate with the passenger. That Uber exercises control of the relationship is what is indicating that Uber is an employer here. Uber pretends you're working for the customer, not them. That is a key element in their attempt to pretend they're not an employer.
- Uber acts as an intermediary party between the contractor and the client (the passenger), so you should compare it to platforms for contract work, such as Upwork, or fiverr, or something like that. The point of Uber is that they're only an intermediate party that puts clients and drivers together. Drivers are not providing a service to Uber. They don't control your rates, they don't stop you from getting jobs if you reject a lot, they don't set any quality minimums for your job, and they don't remove you if someone doesn't give you five stars. In other words, you're not working for these platforms, it's just a marketplace. With Uber, drivers are working for Uber, not for the passengers. However, Uber is pretending to be a marketplace, and it isn't. This sentence just proves that.
