# Time Series Forecasting

## LSTM for Time Series Forecasting
- Univariate LSTM Models : one observation time-series data, predict the next value in the sequence
- Multivariate LSTM Models : two or more observation time-series data, predict the next value in the sequence
    - Multiple Input Series : two or more parallel input time series and an output time series that is dependent on the input time series
    - Multiple Parallel Series : multiple parallel time series and a value must be predicted for each
- Univariate Multi-Step LSTM Models : one observation time-series data, predict the multi step value in the sequence prediction.
- Multivariate Multi-Step LSTM Models :  two or more observation time-series data, predict the multi step value in the sequence prediction.
    - Multiple Input Multi-Step Output.
    - Multiple Parallel Input and Multi-Step Output.
