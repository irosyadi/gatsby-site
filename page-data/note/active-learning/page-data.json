The teacher has taught a particular science theme or topic. The teacher then develops questions and a procedure that guides students through an activity where the results are already known. This method is great to reinforce concepts taught and to introduce students into learning to follow procedures, collect and record data correctly and to confirm and deepen understandings.</li>\n<li>Level 2: Structured Inquiry. The teacher provides the initial question and an outline of the procedure. Students are to formulate explanations of their findings through evaluating and analyzing the data that they collect.</li>\n<li>Level 3: Guided Inquiry. The teacher provides only the research question for the students. The students are responsible for designing and following their own procedures to test that question and then communicate their results and findings.</li>\n<li>Level 4: Open/True Inquiry. Students formulate their own research question(s), design and follow through with a developed procedure, and communicate their findings and results. This type of inquiry is often seen in science fair contexts where students drive their own investigative questions. >>> This is <strong>Problem Based Learning</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"levels-in-science-education\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#levels-in-science-education\" aria-label=\"levels in science education permalink\" class=\"toc-header before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Levels in Science Education</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Students are provided with questions, methods and materials and are challenged to discover relationships between variables</li>\n<li>Students are provided with a question, however, the method for research is up to the students to develop</li>\n<li>Phenomena are proposed but students must develop their own questions and method for research to discover relationships among variables</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"important-aspects\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#important-aspects\" aria-label=\"important aspects permalink\" class=\"toc-header before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Important Aspects</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Students should be able to recognize that science is more than memorizing and knowing facts.</li>\n<li>Students should have the opportunity to develop new knowledge that builds on their prior knowledge and scientific ideas.</li>\n<li>Students will develop new knowledge by restructuring their previous understandings of scientific concepts and adding new information learned.</li>\n<li>Learning is influenced by students' social environment whereby they have an opportunity to learn from each other.</li>\n<li>Students will take control of their learning.</li>\n<li>The extent to which students are able to learn with deep understanding will influence how transferable their new knowledge is to real life contexts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"example-of-formats\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#example-of-formats\" aria-label=\"example of formats permalink\" class=\"toc-header before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Example of Formats</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Field-work</li>\n<li>Case studies</li>\n<li>Investigations</li>\n<li>Individual and group projects</li>\n<li>Research projects</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"problem-based-learning-pbl\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#problem-based-learning-pbl\" aria-label=\"problem based learning pbl permalink\" class=\"toc-header before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Problem-based learning (PBL)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered pedagogy in which students learn about a subject through the experience of solving an open-ended problem found in trigger material. </li>\n<li>The PBL process does not focus on problem solving with a defined solution, but it allows for the development of other desirable skills and attributes.

Before learners can begin to solve a problem, all members must understand and agree on the details of the problem. This consensus forms through collaboration and discussion. Example: Discussion Board, Moodle, Discord</li>\n<li>Research tools. Once the problem has been identified, learners move into the second step of PBL: the information gathering phase. In this phase, learners research the problem by gathering background information and researching potential solutions. This information is shared with the learning team and used to generate potential solutions, each with supporting evidence. Example: Google, Wikipedia.</li>\n<li>Presentation tools. The third most important phase of PBL is resolving the problem, the critical task is presenting and defending your solution to the given problem. Students need to be able to state the problem clearly, describe the process of problem-solving considering different options to overcome difficulties, support the solution using relevant information and data analysis. Being able to communicate and present the solution clearly is the key to the success of this phase as it directly affects the learning outcomes.
