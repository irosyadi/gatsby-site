# Daily Wisdom

- In Nature there are neither rewards nor punishments, there are consequences. -- R.G. Ingersoll
- Have constant reminders/cues (what's important, dreams/expectations)
- Use motivators (music, dreams/aspirations, good and bad)
- Use structure/schedule
- Maintain the same routine, regardless of schedule. Adjust only what is necessary.
- Prioritize (short-term as well as long-term)
- Maintain focus/single-tasking
- Remove/prevent distractions
- Track tasks done/accomplishments
- *Work* vs 'doing stuff'
- Look ahead, look back
- *Tackle* difficult tasks/situations
- Appropriate assertiveness
- Time-limit side treks (eating, news, exploration, entertainment, breaks)
- Don't *worry* about things, *do* things
- Budget marketing (time, money)
- Budget professional development (time, money)
- Reduce discomfort through familiarity/repetition/exposure
- Set goals to 'good enough'/iterative development
- Review lessons learned periodically to solidify/refresh them
- Take small steps
- Don't get emotionally overloaded
- Prioritize tasks that are sliding
- Don't pick apart a good idea, pursue it
- Treat failures as false starts & learning experiences (training exercises)
- Music on 5 minutes before up/downtime (music as motivator)
- Use caffeine to maintain alertness and focus. If it's too late in the day for caffeine, GO TO BED.
- Just START WORKING
- Maintain an appropriate sense of urgency (but avoid panic and burnout)
- Take regular stretch breaks (1 minute per 15)
- End work based on bedtime, not time of day
- Use zazen (shikantaza) to overcome 'scattered thoughts' (too many thoughts or anxious thoughts)
- Don't focus on how *little* time you have, but on *what you can get done* in the time you have.
- If you don't want to do something, *DO* it and get it out of the way.
- Start with the MOST IMPORTANT TASK of the day. Everything else can wait.
- Risk and uncertainty are normal parts of life. Manage them effectively.
- A life is built one thought, one choice, one action at a time.
- Start the day with an unpleasant task, to get it out of the way ('eat the frog').
- #1 underlying principle: Be proactive (and thereby stay in control).
- My primary motivator is: Responsibility (reactive)
- Be yourself. Do your thing.
- Program a 'computer-free day' per week.
- Use habits to: Reduce processing overhead, Simplify things, Reduce chances for getting off-track, Reduce ability of subconscious to derail
- Don't allow a slipped schedule to be an excuse for avoiding things.
- When projects are slipping, focus exclusively on blockers. Everything else can wait.
- 'Do very few things, but be awesome at them.'
- 'Do less shallow work â€” focus on the deep stuff.'
- Create your own stability.
- You can be successful without being happy (i.e., you don't need to be happy in order to be successful; you can still be successful even if you aren't able to be happy).
- Focus on what you are responsible for.
- To avoid binging something, limit yourself to one unit per day; if appropriate, follow it with something (anything) else
- For video entertainment, set a goal of 'saving' before the end/climacs (preemptive pause); don't get hooked to continue to the next unit (level, show, etc.)
- You don't need to feel good all the time (i.e., even if you don't feel good, keep moving forward).
- When you feel overwhelmed, pick ONE THING to focus on, ignore everything else; then when that's done, pick ONE THING....
- Don't 'chain' tasks if it causes the whole chain to be put off; do what you can NOW and worry about the rest later
- If you can't do everything that needs to be done, do SOMETHING (could be a small piece of 'everything', or just one more-manageable task)
- I don't need to feel good to do daily things.
- You can't make up for lost time; make the best of what you have (left).
- Work is life (life requires work).
- Don't focus on what's wrong, but on what can be done to make things better.
- 3..2..1 (countdown, then just do it)
- Eat the frog!
