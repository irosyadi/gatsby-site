If I don’t understand something, I have a sense of why it is difficult to understand or what prerequisite knowledge I am missing.

Putt's Law: "Technology is dominated by two types of people:  those who understand what they do not manage and those who manage what they do not understand."

Putt's Corollary: "Every technical hierarchy, in time, develops a competence inversion." --> technically competent people remain directly in charge of the actual technology while those without technical competence move into management.

Dilbert principle: "leadership is nature's way of removing morons from the productive flow" --> that companies tend to systematically promote their least competent employees to management, to limit the amount of damage they are capable of doing.

Parkinson's law is the adage that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion". --> growth of the bureaucracy
The demand upon a resource tends to expand to match the supply of the resource (If the price is zero).The reverse is not true.

## Poems
- [If— by Rudyard Kipling - Poems | Academy of American Poets](https://poets.org/poem/if)

If you can keep your head when all about you  
 Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;  
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  
 But make allowance for their doubting too;  
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  
 Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,  
Or, being hated, don’t give way to hating,  
 And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  
 If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;  
If you can meet with triumph and disaster  
 And treat those two impostors just the same;  
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken  
 Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,  
 And stoop and build ’em up with wornout tools;

If you can make one heap of all your winnings  
 And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,  
And lose, and start again at your beginnings  
 And never breathe a word about your loss;  
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  
 To serve your turn long after they are gone,  
And so hold on when there is nothing in you  
 Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on”;

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  
 Or walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;  
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;  
 If all men count with you, but none too much;  
If you can fill the unforgiving minute  
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run—  
 Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,  
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!


## Will Rogers Phenomenon

The Will Rogers phenomenon is obtained when moving an element from one set to another set raises the average values of both sets:

_When the Okies left Oklahoma and moved to California, they raised the average intelligence level in both states._

The effect will occur when both of these conditions are met:  

- The element being moved is below average for its current set. Removing it will raise the average of the remaining elements.
- The element being moved is above the current average of the set it is entering. Adding it to the new set will raise its average.

## Judgement
> My willingness to judge something should be proportional to how much I know about it.

[My Seatbelt Rule for Judgment](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/my-seatbelt-rule-for-judgment/)

> Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place.
