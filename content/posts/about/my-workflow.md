## My Workflow

### Writing

I write the notes using [VNote](https://tamlok.gitee.io/vnote/en_us/). After comparing some note taking apps (Obsidian, Zettlr, etc.), I choose it for some reasons:

- markdown-it support
- markdown with Mathjax plug-in
- it can be hosted in Github Pages easily with [Viki](https://tamlok.gitee.io/viki/).

### Hosting

My personal wiki is available in three static host:

- [at Netlify](https://irosyadi.netlify.app/) using [Gatsby Starter Bee](https://github.com/JaeYeopHan/gatsby-starter-bee), because:
    - it supports markdown files and folder structures
    - it is integrated with GitHub
    - it has RSS feed
    - it is fast
- [at Gitbook Site](https://irosyadi.gitbook.io/) using Gitbook, because:
    - it supports markdown files and folder structures
    - it is integrated with GitHub
    - it supports full text search
- [at GitHub Pages](https://irosyadi.github.io/) using Viki, because:
    - it supports markdown files and folder structures
    - it is integrated with GitHub
    - it supports VNote structure

### Syncing

So, I need to sync the notes to Gitbook and Netlify repository, and I use [SyncFolder](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/syncfolder/9nc73mjwhsww) for Windows 10.

### Workflow

So, here are my workflow:

- Write markdown notes using VNote
- Sync all the files and folders with SyncFolder
- Push to Github
- ...
- Profit

### Problems with Workflow

- Ensure to make consistent format between Gitbook and Gatsby Starter Bee
- index.md in Viki will be displayed as the first page, but it will be displayed as the last page in Gitbook
- readme.md will be displayed as the first page of Gitbook
- No first line texxt in Gitbook. We should start with Header to make Gitbook display the correct Header.
- In Gitbook, you cannot have two Header 1's or more.
- In Gatsby, you need a title. So if you have both title and Header 1, both will be displayed in Gatsby site.
