Experience

*   Matplotlib is very slow given the amount of data I try to display.
*   Modern Browser-based solutions like Bokeh are likely to have similar limitations and are more meant for 2D data only
*   Several libraries based on OpenGL are missing some step-by-step tutorials, have sparse docs, or are deprecated.
*   There are still solutions like PyQtGraph, Vispy or Mayavi that I could try (What is the best to begin with for the described purpose?)
*   Pure PyOpenGL solution will be lacking all the goodies of simple plotting capabilities. But I could write them myself, potentially.
*   Library like Open3D could be nice but it the way it handles data transformation makes it infeasible for my use case.
*   ROS/Rviz or other well-known robotics tools.
* pygame for 2d animations.
* panda3d for 3d animations.
