## PhD Management
- Advisor should express his expectations for student finishing and tailoring those expectations to student career goals clear up front
- Each time, make evaluation of those expectations
- Create a expectation document, for example, it will contain target like:
    - 1 journal paper as the first author, so that they learn how that process (often is a review or perspective paper on their field, which goes in their dissertation)
    - 2 first author papers in top-tier machine learning venues (goes in dissertation)
    - 1 first author paper in a top-tier or second tier venue (goes in dissertation)
    - 1 collaborative paper with another PhD student (have to learn how to collaborate)
