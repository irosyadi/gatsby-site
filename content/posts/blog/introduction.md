Hi ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to my digital garden.

Before you explore my garden, here is a random cat which life inside the garden.

I write immediately random thougt or something I found. Usually, I write it into a blog note. Then, in my spare time, I will expand them into a specific note or put them to the related note and category. 

At the moment, here are the categories:

* App: Collection of interesting web, desktop, or phone apps.
* Blog: Random notes.
* Book: Collection of interesting books.
* Catatan: Categorical notes, but in Indonesian.
* Course: Course notes for my students.
* Development: Notes about how I develop this site.
* How To: How-to notes.
* Markdown: Notes about markdown syntax.
* Note: Categorical notes, in English.
* Research: Notes related to my research.

I wrote my notes in Markdown (markdown-it flavor) using VNote in my Windows 10 laptop. Then I push them to Github. So my notes can also be read in Github. Then I make them live as THREE static websites.

Why do I need THREE websites for my similar notes? I dunno. They were started as my experiment so I could choose the better one. But as time flies, they are live together. I need to sync the notes structure using SyncFolder app in Windows.

So here are all of the sites:
- ðŸ“˜ https://irosyadi.github.io : a Jekyll site, served by Github.
- ðŸ“™ https://irosyadi.gitbook.io : a Gitbook site, served by Gitbook.
- ðŸ“• https://irosyadi.netlify.app : a Gatsby site, served by Netlify.

Thank you for exploring.
And here is another cat.
